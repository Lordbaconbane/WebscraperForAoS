ACID-FUELLED FLAME: Te fery 
secretions belched up by the Spawn of 
Chotec melt armour and fesh long afer 
they have hit their targets.
Efect: Each time this unit uses a Shoot
ability, you must pick either its Glob 
of Flame Acid or its Stream of Fire
ranged weapon.
In addition, afer resolving shooting 
attacks made with this unit’s Glob of 
Flame Acid, if any damage points were 
allocated to an enemy unit by those 
attacks, subtract 1 from save rolls for that 
enemy unit for the rest of the turn.
SUN ACOLYTES: Te Sun Acolytes that 
accompany a Spawn of Chotec carry out 
complex tasks upon the battlefeld safe 
in the knowledge that the salamander 
serves as a deadly deterrent to would-
be attackers.
Efect: Tis unit has a crew of 3 
Sun Acolytes that are tokens.
Add 1 to this unit’s control score for each 
Sun Acolyte it has. If this unit has no 
Sun Acolytes, it has a maximum control 
score of 1 for the rest of the battle.
Each time you make an unmodifed save 
roll of 1 for this unit, remove 1 of its 
Sun Acolytes from the battlefeld afer 
the Attack ability has been resolved (the 
damage point is still inficted).

SERAPHON
Tis Spearhead army consists 
of the following units:
GENERAL
 Saurus Oldblood on 
Carnosaur
UNITS
 5 Saurus Warriors
 5 Saurus Warriors
 3 Kroxigor
Cold-blooded and enigmatic, the Seraphon are a merciless race. Tese 
reptilian warriors are utterly committed to their masters’ Great Plan, and 
any who interfere – intentionally or otherwise – with that cosmic design 
are marked for obliteration. Ofen, it is a Starscale Warhost that will be 
dispatched to ensure the Plan’s continuation. Whether tracking down a 
target marked for death by the esoteric slann or defending the enchanted 
jungles in which the Seraphon dwell, these forces are more than a match for 
their warm-blooded adversaries.
Cohorts of Saurus Warriors are the heart of each Starscale Warhost. As 
savage on the attack as they are formidable on the defence, they can excel 
even when outnumbered. At their side lumber the Kroxigor; though these 
towering brutes are primarily labourers, their immense strength makes them 
well suited for battle, making red ruin of more stubborn adversaries. Te 
greatest weapon of a Starscale Warhost, however, is its saurus overlord and 
the monstrous Carnosaur upon which they ride. Coaxed from the deepest 
jungles, Carnosaurs are living engines of destruction, capable of swallowing 
warriors whole. Guided by the strategic instincts of the Oldbloods, a 
Starscale Warhost is a brutal weapon in service of the Great Plan.
STARSCALE WARHOST
‘Warmbloods come. Warmbloods die.’
– Oldblood Groq

to wield the destructive relics 
of the Old Ones but to master 
a Carnosaur – a huge bipedal 
monster of ancient times. Te 
battle frenzy of a Carnosaur is,

Te saurus are the warrior 
caste of the Seraphon race. 
From the moment they emerge 
from the spawning pools, they 
are perfectly adapted for their 
task: muscular, protected by 
iron-hard scales and possessing 
vicious claws and teeth. Saurus 
are predators by nature, capable 
of fghting with immense 
savagery, yet though their 
minds are focused entirely on 
war, they are not mindless. 
Tey share a bond with their 
spawn-kin that goes beyond 
words, allowing them to fght

discipline in the prosecution of 
the Great Plan.

Kroxigor are towering brutes, 
spawned in aeons past to serve 
as the physical labourers of the 
Seraphon. Teir comparative 
lack of intellect is ofset by their 
primitive determination and, 
most of all, their terrifying 
strength – strength that can 
see them snatch an armoured 
knight from the saddle and rip 
them apart. When war calls, 
the might of the Kroxigor is 
brought to bear against the 
Seraphon’s enemies. Wielding 
toothed mauls and hammers 
that glow with celestial energies, 
the Kroxigor demolish foes 
with broad and punishing 
swings while shrugging of their 
panicked retaliatory strikes.

Tis Spearhead army consists 
of the following units:
GENERAL
 Saurus Oldblood on 
Carnosaur
UNITS
 5 Saurus Warriors
 5 Saurus Warriors
 3 Kroxigor
Cold-blooded and enigmatic, the Seraphon are a merciless race. Tese 
reptilian warriors are utterly committed to their masters’ Great Plan, and 
any who interfere – intentionally or otherwise – with that cosmic design 
are marked for obliteration. Ofen, it is a Starscale Warhost that will be 
dispatched to ensure the Plan’s continuation. Whether tracking down a 
target marked for death by the esoteric slann or defending the enchanted 
jungles in which the Seraphon dwell, these forces are more than a match for 
their warm-blooded adversaries.
Cohorts of Saurus Warriors are the heart of each Starscale Warhost. As 
savage on the attack as they are formidable on the defence, they can excel 
even when outnumbered. At their side lumber the Kroxigor; though these 
towering brutes are primarily labourers, their immense strength makes them 
well suited for battle, making red ruin of more stubborn adversaries. Te 
greatest weapon of a Starscale Warhost, however, is its saurus overlord and 
the monstrous Carnosaur upon which they ride. Coaxed from the deepest 
jungles, Carnosaurs are living engines of destruction, capable of swallowing 
warriors whole. Guided by the strategic instincts of the Oldbloods, a 
Starscale Warhost is a brutal weapon in service of the Great Plan.
STARSCALE WARHOST
‘Warmbloods come. Warmbloods die.’

As a saurus ages, their body 
become even more fnely honed 
for war, and greater degrees 
of tactical skill are unlocked 
within them. Tey become able 
to orchestrate grand fanking 
attacks and sudden feints, 
though they still act upon 
instinct above all. Tey also 
grow to possess the will not only 
to wield the destructive relics 
of the Old Ones but to master 
a Carnosaur – a huge bipedal 
monster of ancient times. Te 
battle frenzy of a Carnosaur is, 
if anything, even greater than its 
saurus rider, and together beast 
and master can tear apart even 
the most terrible of adversaries.

Te saurus are the warrior 
caste of the Seraphon race. 
From the moment they emerge 
from the spawning pools, they 
are perfectly adapted for their 
task: muscular, protected by 
iron-hard scales and possessing 
vicious claws and teeth. Saurus 
are predators by nature, capable 
of fghting with immense 
savagery, yet though their 
minds are focused entirely on 
war, they are not mindless. 
Tey share a bond with their 
spawn-kin that goes beyond 
words, allowing them to fght 
with uncanny coordination and 
discipline in the prosecution of 
the Great Plan.

Kroxigor are towering brutes, 
spawned in aeons past to serve 
as the physical labourers of the 
Seraphon. Teir comparative 
lack of intellect is ofset by their 
primitive determination and, 
most of all, their terrifying 
strength – strength that can 
see them snatch an armoured 
knight from the saddle and rip 
them apart. When war calls, 
the might of the Kroxigor is 
brought to bear against the 
Seraphon’s enemies. Wielding 
toothed mauls and hammers 
that glow with celestial energies, 
the Kroxigor demolish foes 
with broad and punishing 
swings while shrugging of their 
panicked retaliatory strikes.

SERAPHON
Tis Spearhead army consists 
of the following units:
GENERAL
 Saurus Oldblood on 
Carnosaur
UNITS
 5 Saurus Warriors
 5 Saurus Warriors
 3 Kroxigor
Cold-blooded and enigmatic, the Seraphon are a merciless race. Tese 
reptilian warriors are utterly committed to their masters’ Great Plan, and 
any who interfere – intentionally or otherwise – with that cosmic design 
are marked for obliteration. Ofen, it is a Starscale Warhost that will be 
dispatched to ensure the Plan’s continuation. Whether tracking down a 
target marked for death by the esoteric slann or defending the enchanted 
jungles in which the Seraphon dwell, these forces are more than a match for 
their warm-blooded adversaries.
Cohorts of Saurus Warriors are the heart of each Starscale Warhost. As 
savage on the attack as they are formidable on the defence, they can excel 
even when outnumbered. At their side lumber the Kroxigor; though these 
towering brutes are primarily labourers, their immense strength makes them 
well suited for battle, making red ruin of more stubborn adversaries. Te 
greatest weapon of a Starscale Warhost, however, is its saurus overlord and 
the monstrous Carnosaur upon which they ride. Coaxed from the deepest 
jungles, Carnosaurs are living engines of destruction, capable of swallowing 
warriors whole. Guided by the strategic instincts of the Oldbloods, a 
Starscale Warhost is a brutal weapon in service of the Great Plan.
STARSCALE WARHOST
‘Warmbloods come. Warmbloods die.’
– Oldblood Groq

BEAST OF THE DARK JUNGLES: Te perilous 
jungles of the Seraphon are the hunting grounds of the

to wield the destructive relics 
of the Old Ones but to master 
a Carnosaur – a huge bipedal 
monster of ancient times. Te 
battle frenzy of a Carnosaur is,

Te saurus are the warrior

From the moment they emerge 
from the spawning pools, they 
are perfectly adapted for their 
task: muscular, protected by 
iron-hard scales and possessing 
vicious claws and teeth. Saurus 
are predators by nature, capable 
of fghting with immense 
savagery, yet though their 
minds are focused entirely on 
war, they are not mindless. 
Tey share a bond with their

words, allowing them to fght

Kroxigor are towering brutes, 
spawned in aeons past to serve 
as the physical labourers of the 
Seraphon. Teir comparative 
lack of intellect is ofset by their 
primitive determination and, 
most of all, their terrifying 
strength – strength that can 
see them snatch an armoured 
knight from the saddle and rip 
them apart. When war calls, 
the might of the Kroxigor is 
brought to bear against the 
Seraphon’s enemies. Wielding 
toothed mauls and hammers 
that glow with celestial energies, 
the Kroxigor demolish foes 
with broad and punishing 
swings while shrugging of their 
panicked retaliatory strikes.
